### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Challenges that occured during this assignment was understanding the implementation of connecting the labels and image view in the view cell.
- Understanding how the storyboards help with the UI and how it can be implemented in the backend such as getting the information in a form of a dictionary.
- Dictionaries was a topic that was challenging because it was a topic that I wasn't familiar.
